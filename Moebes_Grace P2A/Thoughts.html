		<li>I have always had weird dreams</li>
		<li>I've been having dreams involving cats for the past few nights</li>
			<ul>
				<li> One featured oversized house cats at an abandoned county fair. They were the size of ponies and you could harness and ride them. </li>
				<li> Last night I had one about my own cat, Alley, who resides with my parents. I guess I miss her subconsciously.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>This past week, my dreams have been sort of unsettling. I think it is just anxiety from working and school and everything.</li>
